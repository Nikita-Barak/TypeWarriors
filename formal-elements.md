### 1. Players
- Suitable for players of all skill levels, but especially aimed at beginners and intermediate players in touch typing who are looking to improve their skills in a fun way.
- The game is designed for a single player, but includes a scoreboard to encourage competition among online players.

### 2. Objectives
- Type words accurately and quickly to defeat enemies and progress through levels.
- Each level includes stronger enemies and more complex words, challenging the player's typing abilities.
- Objectives are displayed at the top of the screen and change as new enemies appear.

### 3. Processes
- **Starting Process**: The game opens with a quick tutorial screen explaining the basic controls—how to type a word to attack and use spell icons for assistance in battle. In the first thirty seconds, the player encounters a simple enemy with an easy word, allowing for an immediate success experience.
- **Core Process**: The player types words appearing above enemies, with each correct entry reducing the enemy's health. As the player progresses, the words become longer and more difficult. Special spells can be activated by typing specific word sequences like "shield" or "blast" to aid the player.
- **End Process**: At the end of each level, the player receives a performance summary—typing speed, accuracy, and the number of enemies defeated. The player continues until they finish all levels or lose in a particularly challenging boss battle. The main controls are the keyboard, and the game guides the player through gradual mission progression.

### 4. Rules
- The main rule is that each enemy appears with a new word the player must type without errors to attack.
- If the player types too slowly, the enemy counterattacks, reducing the player's health.
- Players learn game rules through a brief tutorial and personal experience, with hints about spells and their activation.

### 5. Resources
- The primary resource is the player's health. Players lose health for typing errors or typing too slowly.
- Additionally, spells like "shield" and "blast" protect the player, reducing damage or enhancing attacks. These resources are periodically available, but players must quickly type specific words to activate them.
- Spells are displayed at the bottom of the screen with a cooldown gauge showing when they'll be available again.

### 6. Conflicts
- **Player vs. System**: Enemies that appear during the game demand quick response and precision.
- **Player vs. Self**: As words become more difficult and faster, players may struggle to maintain concentration and a proper typing rhythm.

### 7. Boundaries
- The game takes place in a closed world with a flat structure. Players are shown the map boundary, featuring natural landscape and platform barriers. The game guides the player forward in a structured way, highlighting landscapes and enemies that appear progressively to maintain interest and direction.

### 8. Outcomes
- The game ends in victory when the player completes all levels or loses when the character's health reaches zero. The outcome depends primarily on player skill-typing speed and accuracy, with minor reliance on spells and strategy.
- The game is competitive rather than cooperative, with integrated rankings to encourage player comparison.
