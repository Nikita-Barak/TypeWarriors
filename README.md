## Gameplay

### Objectives
- Type words accurately to defeat enemies and advance through levels.
- Each level introduces more complex words to challenge the player's typing skills.
- The current objective is displayed at the top of the screen and changes as new enemies appear.

### Player Experience
- **Single-player Mode**: The game is played by one player, but in future updates will introduce a leaderboard to foster competition among players worldwide.

### Game Flow
1. **Core Gameplay**: Players type words displayed above enemies, reducing their health with each correct entry. Words become progressively longer and more challenging. Failing to type a word correctly means getting attacked by the enemy.
2. **Completion**: In the future, at the end of each level, players receive a summary of their performance, including typing speed and accuracy.
  
### Rules
- Each enemy appears with a new word bank that must be typed accurately to strike.
- Players will learn the mechanics through a future initial tutorial and gradual exposure to harder words as the game progresses.

### Resources
- **Health**: The primary resource, reduced by typing errors or slow responses. There is no way to regain health throughout a fight, adding to the complexity.

### Challenges
- **Enemies**: Require precise typing in order to attack them, and only one typing error is required to be attacked by them.
- **Self-challenge**: As words grow more difficult, maintaining typing speed and accuracy becomes more demanding.

### Boundaries
The game features a closed, structured world where each level guides players forward with a natural boundary of landscapes and platforms. Enemies appear progressively to maintain player engagement and provide a clear sense of direction.

### Results
- **Victory**: Achieved by completing all levels.
- **Defeat**: Occurs if the player’s health runs out, and restarts the current fight.
- The outcome is skill-dependent, based on the player's typing skills. Although the game's not aimed to be actively competitive as it’s not a multiplayer game, rankings will be included to encourage competition among players.

## Target Audience
